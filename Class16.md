What is the difference between a graph and a tree
- graph can have cylces
- graph can be directed or undirected
- graphs can have weighted edges
---

Graphs
- a set of verticies and a set of edges
  - you need the vericies and then you need to know which of them are connected to eachother
- a path is a series of edges connecting two verticies

 In a graph there are really two traversals

 DFS - depth first
 BFS - breadth first
