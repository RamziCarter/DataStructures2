SDLC

- it all starts with a plan
- what should your program do?
- What is the purpose?
- What do the customer require your tool to acomplish?
```
Requirement analysis

Evolution

> How?
- where is the data saved?
- How is it entered or displayed?
- How is it secured?

> Implementation
- this is where you turn ideas into code

> Testing
- an essential part of development and cannot be overlooked

> Release
- live demo and publishing of application
- After real users provide feedback on the requirements and utilization
- the product will evolve when adding or revamping features
- collect opinions and repeat the cycle

> Project Documentation

> Version Control Lingo
- add
  - once you have a repository configured, you must tell the vcs which files you want to keep track of
- commit
  - when you want to save a version of the file to the repository
  - usually, this would be when you have reached some key point in getting your program working
  - you can commit one file or several simultaneously
  - you add a commit message with the changes you made to files to give a brief description
- Update
  - to download all the changes that have been made to the project
- Branching
  - when you develop something that might be a big change, you can develop safely without causing issues with the main branch
  - then you can MERGE both together when you figure out that code for the branch is working
