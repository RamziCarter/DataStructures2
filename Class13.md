> Quick Sort
- we use pivots to start the sorting algorithm
- Quick sort is generally quick. Depending on the algorthim, even if you picked the worst possible pivot. 
Each time you are pulling out the maximum. In the worst case scenario the time complexity is O(n^2)
most of the time quick sort will be n log (n)

__Example Below__

```
      10 2 4 7 12 16 8 6 3 5 17 20 9
      
                  8
      
      2 4 7 3 6 5   10 12 16 17 20
      
          6                17
      
 2 4 3 5    7     10 12 16    20
